#Using WizeBit as an alternative WEB network.

	Today, an ever-increasing problem of the WEB network is the restriction of information dissemination by regulators, censorship, restriction of anonymity and freedom of expression.
	The developed software and network complex WizeBit has in its architectural basis all the necessary capabilities to provide the end user with services that solve the above-mentioned shortcomings of the existing WEB network. To solve the described problem, developers need to develop 2 basic tools that allow to emulate web sites inside the WizeBit network. It is necessary to develop:

	- standard for storing files when accessing to which the available content analogue of the WEB page will be formed;
	- web browser on the basis of an existing desktop application for viewing the above-described web pages;
	- routing protocol between the WEB application pages;
	- nodes for storing addresses of WEB sites located inside the WizeBit network;
